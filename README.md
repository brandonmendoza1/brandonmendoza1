## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brandon, and I'm a recent Business Analytics graduate interested in all things business analytics, data science, and visualization!

ðŸŒ± Currently, Iâ€™m learning:

SQL & Python for data analysis

Data visualization with Tableau & Power BI

Machine learning basics

ðŸ“Š My goal is to grow into a well-rounded data analytics professional who can bridge the gap between raw data and actionable strategy.

ðŸ’¡ Outside of data, I enjoy continuous learning, collaborating on projects, and exploring how analytics can solve meaningful problems.
